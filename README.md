- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Oriane Lanfranchi and I'm a 5th-year Computer Science and Engineering student at UniversitÃ© de Technologie de CompiÃ¨gne (UTC), in France.
- ğŸ‘€ I thrive on addressing technical challenges, particularly when they lead to creative or innovative solutions. In parallel with my studies, I have a strong interest in video game development, which enables me to integrate creativity, technical expertise, and artistic skills with the visual and narrative elements of gaming.
